### Kubernetes Pods
#### Challenge 1

Challenge 1: Run an alpine linux pod and execute commands within a running container. Use the following as a starting point:
```
kubectl run alpine --image=alpine --restart=Never --rm -it -- /bin/sh
```
When inside the container, run the following command -
```
cat /etc/alpine-release
```
And then exit from the container.

Question: In the example, what does the ‘—restart=Never’ option do?
Answer:
The --restart=Never option tells Kubernetes not to restart the containers in the pod if they exit. In other words, the containers within the pod will run only once and will not be restarted automatically if they fail or are terminated for any reason

Question: What is the purpose of the — parameter?
Answer:
The -- parameter in the kubectl run command is used to separate the Kubernetes command-line options from the container command and its arguments. It signals the end of the Kubernetes-specific options and the beginning of the container command and its arguments which in this case, is an instruction to execute the command /bin/sh to run as an interactive shell

Question: Check if the pod still exists (issue the commands to check even if you believe it is removed), explain why it does or does not exist
Answer:
The container was not restarted by Kubernetes, therefore it will not exist on the Kubernetes output. Depending on the timing, this may be visible temporarily via nerdctl until it is cleaned up in the background.



Challenge 2: Re-run the same command but this time remove the —rm option, exit the container after it begins:
```
kubectl run alpine --image=alpine --restart=Never -it -- /bin/sh
```

If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
/ # 
/ # exit
Question: What is the status of the container in a kubectl get pods -o output

Question: What does this status mean?
When you see "Completed" in the output of kubectl get pods, it indicates the status of a pod where all its containers have successfully terminated and will not be restarted. This typically happens when the containers have finished their intended tasks and exited with a zero (successful) exit status. We executed /bin/sh and we issued an exit command, hence the container transitioned to Completed


Challenge 3:

Delete the pod by issuing:
```
kubectl delete pod/alpine
```
Issue a command to confirm that the pod has been deleted.

```
kubectl get pods
```

Challenge 4:

Task 1 - Create a pod running the Alpine Linux image with a custom environment variable, MY_VARIABLE, set to "Hello, Kubernetes!" Use the following example as a starting point
```
kubectl run alpine --image=alpine --restart=Never --rm -it -- /bin/sh
```
kubectl run alpine --image=alpine --restart=Never --rm -it --env="MY_VARIABLE=Hello, Kubernetes!" -- /bin/sh
```
Hint: You will need to use the —env command line option


Task 2 - Verify that the environment variable is available within the pod
```
root@control-plane:~# kubectl run alpine --image=alpine --restart=Never --rm -it --env="MY_VARIABLE=Hello, Kubernetes!" -- /bin/sh
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
/ # env
